# Admin Guide - Asset Manager

This guide covers all admin operations for managing the asset marketplace.

## 1. Set Up the Fee Collection Account

Before any trading can occur, the admin must create a **platform-wide XAF savings account** that collects all trading fees.

1. Create a new XAF savings account in Fineract (under a platform/admin client)
2. Approve and activate the account
3. Set the account ID in the environment variable `FEE_COLLECTION_ACCOUNT_ID`

This account is shared across all assets. All trading fees (BUY and SELL) are transferred to this account.

---

## 2. Create a New Asset

Creating an asset is a multi-step process that provisions resources in Fineract.

### Prerequisites
- A **company client** must exist in Fineract (legalForm = ENTITY)
- The company must have an **active XAF savings account** (auto-detected during provisioning)

### API Call

```
POST /api/admin/assets
Headers: Authorization: Bearer {jwt}
Body:
{
  "name": "Douala Tower Token",
  "symbol": "DTT",
  "currencyCode": "DTT",
  "description": "Tokenized commercial real estate in Douala",
  "category": "REAL_ESTATE",
  "initialPrice": 5000,
  "tradingFeePercent": 0.50,
  "spreadPercent": 1.00,
  "totalSupply": 100000,
  "decimalPlaces": 0,
  "treasuryClientId": 42,
  "expectedLaunchDate": "2026-03-15"
}
```

### What Happens on Create

1. Auto-detects the company's active XAF savings account for trade settlements
2. Registers `DTT` as a custom currency in Fineract (`PUT /currencies`)
2. Creates a savings product for DTT with cash-based accounting (GL 47 → GL 65)
3. Creates a treasury savings account for the company client
4. Approves and activates the treasury account
5. Deposits 100,000 DTT units into treasury
6. Persists the asset in PENDING status
7. Initializes price data at 5,000 XAF

The asset starts in **PENDING** status and must be explicitly activated.

---

## 3. Activate an Asset

```
POST /api/admin/assets/{id}/activate
```

Transitions the asset from PENDING to ACTIVE. Trading becomes possible immediately — users buy at current price + spread, sell at current price - spread.

---

## 4. Manage Pricing

### Manual Price Override

```
POST /api/admin/assets/{id}/set-price
Body: { "price": 5500 }
```

Updates the current price immediately. Useful for initial pricing or corrections.

### Price Modes

- **MANUAL**: Price only changes via admin API calls
- **AUTO**: Price updates based on trade execution (updated on each trade)

---

## 5. Halt / Resume Trading

### Halt Trading

```
POST /api/admin/assets/{id}/halt
```

Transitions status to HALTED. All buy/sell requests are rejected with `TRADING_HALTED`.

### Resume Trading

```
POST /api/admin/assets/{id}/resume
```

Transitions back to ACTIVE.

## 6. Monitor Inventory

```
GET /api/admin/assets/inventory
```

Response:
```json
[
  {
    "assetId": "uuid",
    "symbol": "DTT",
    "name": "Douala Tower Token",
    "totalSupply": 100000,
    "circulatingSupply": 15000,
    "availableSupply": 85000,
    "treasuryBalance": 85000
  }
]
```

Key metrics:
- **Total Supply**: Total units ever minted
- **Circulating Supply**: Units held by customers
- **Available Supply**: Units remaining in treasury
- **Treasury Balance**: Fineract savings account balance for the asset currency

## 7. Update Asset Metadata

```
PUT /api/admin/assets/{id}
Body:
{
  "name": "Updated Name",
  "description": "New description",
  "imageUrl": "https://new-image.jpg",
  "category": "REAL_ESTATE",
  "tradingFeePercent": 0.75,
