# API Services Explained: The Difference Between Account Management and Transactions

`SavingsAccountService` and `SavingsAccountTransactionsService`. They sound similar, but they have very distinct roles in the application. This document clarifies the difference and explains how they work together to create the user experience.

Think of it like this: one service manages the **thing** (the account), and the other service manages the **actions** you can perform with that thing (the transactions).

## 1. `SavingsAccountService`: Managing the Account Itself

-   **What it does**: This service is responsible for the savings account as an *entity*. It handles administrative and informational tasks related to the account's existence and properties.
-   **Key Responsibilities**:
    -   Creating a new savings account.
    -   Retrieving the details of an account (like its status, product type, and, importantly, its **balance**).
    -   Updating an account's properties.
    -   Approving, activating, or closing an account.
-   **How we use it in `cashier-app`**:
    -   We use **`getV1SavingsaccountsByAccountId`** in the [`SavingsAccountCard`](frontend/cashier-app/src/components/SavingsAccountCard/index.tsx) component.
    -   **Why?** Because we need to get the **current balance** of the account, which is a property *of the account itself*. This method gives us the complete, detailed information about that specific account.

## 2. `SavingsAccountTransactionsService`: Managing Actions on the Account

-   **What it does**: This service is responsible for all the *actions* that happen *to* a savings account. It doesn't care about the account's properties; it only cares about processing deposits, withdrawals, and other financial events.
-   **Key Responsibilities**:
    -   Creating a new deposit or withdrawal.
    -   Searching for past transactions.
    -   Retrieving the details of a specific past transaction.
    -   Reversing or modifying a transaction.
-   **How we use it in `cashier-app`**:
    -   We use **`postV1SavingsaccountsBySavingsIdTransactions`** in the [`ClientDetails`](frontend/cashier-app/src/components/ClientDetails/index.tsx) component (specifically, in the `useClientDetails` hook).
    -   **Why?** Because when the cashier fills out the transaction form, we need to perform an **action**: either `deposit` or `withdrawal`. This service is the one that tells the Fineract backend to execute that action.

## How They Work Together: A Step-by-Step Flow

Here is the sequence of how these two services collaborate in the `cashier-app`:

1.  **User navigates to the Client Details page.**
2.  The `ClientService` is used to get a list of the client's savings accounts (e.g., Account A, Account B). This list contains only basic summary data.
3.  The application renders a `SavingsAccountCard` for each account.
4.  **Inside each `SavingsAccountCard`**:
    -   The **`SavingsAccountService`** is called (`getV1SavingsaccountsByAccountId`).
    -   **Purpose**: To fetch the detailed information for that specific account, most importantly the **account balance**.
5.  **Cashier clicks "Deposit" on the card for Account A.**
6.  A transaction modal opens. The cashier enters an amount and clicks "Submit."
7.  **The `ClientDetails` component's logic takes over**:
    -   The **`SavingsAccountTransactionsService`** is called (`postV1SavingsaccountsBySavingsIdTransactions`).
    -   **Purpose**: To tell the backend, "Perform a `deposit` action on Account A for this amount."

## Summary

| Service                               | Responsibility                               | Analogy               | Used In...                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`SavingsAccountService`**           | Manages the account as an object (its data)  | The Bank Vault        | [`SavingsAccountCard`](frontend/cashier-app/src/components/SavingsAccountCard/index.tsx) (to check what's inside the vault)      |
| **`SavingsAccountTransactionsService`** | Manages actions on the account (deposits)    | The Teller's Window   | [`ClientDetails`](frontend/cashier-app/src/components/ClientDetails/index.tsx) (to process a transaction at the window) |

By separating these concerns, the API provides a clean and logical structure. We use one service to get information *about* the account and another to perform actions *with* the account.
